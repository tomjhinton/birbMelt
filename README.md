# birbMelt

- Wanted to do smart people stuff
- Intention was to do melty droplets in a lava lamp
- That's metaballs /marching cubes I reckon.
- There's even a three [example](https://threejs.org/examples/webgl_marchingcubes.html)
- Jamie Wong blogpost on how to do [this stuff](http://jamie-wong.com/2014/08/19/metaballs-and-marching-squares/)
- Ran out of time / ability
- So very quick ray marching thing with Ineqgo Quilez providing his lovely [opSmoothUnion function](https://iquilezles.org/articles/distfunctions/)


- Played around with some changing color stuff, dont actually like the effect, you can turn it on by pressing ESC and then stuff will change if you click the title.
- Did give me an excuse to play with some of the built in [color functions](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/math/Color) that THREE has.
- Useful if you want to grab colors from a model or material and pass them into CSS or a shader.
